when user logs in for the first time they should be prompted to connect their garmin account and sync their data (setup integrations and profile)
this should be done seamlessly and shouldnt take long and should have good ui design, being simple, intuitive, and easy to use, while looking nice and modern
then they should be prompted to take a survey to get their goals and preferences

when user logs in with germin account they should be prompted to sync their data and sync should happen in the background
when user logs in with strava account they should be prompted to sync their data and sync should happen in the background

user should then fill out a survey to get their goals and preferences
after survey is completed user should be directed to the interview questions

Once the user has answered all of the relevant context from the first question they should then be asked the next question in the interview questions Overview
once all questions have been asked and answered the context and information should be saved to the user_context table
