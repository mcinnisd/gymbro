This is currently in development, eventually it will be an app and website where users will be able to get interactive feedback from an AI trainer. Workouts and meals can be tracked along with metrics from strava or health devices. Personalized summaries will be generated based on user goals along with plans to achieve those goals.

The current roadmap is as follows:

1. Clean up the repo and make it more organized <-- Check
2. Get a simple local website up and running with user logins <-- Check

  a. Clean up website <-- sorta check but need to do more

  b. Troubleshoot errors with pages <-- check

  c. Make sure all pages load requests from backend <-- fine for now, more through testing needed
  
  d. Make chatbot page and infrastructure <-- Check

3. Develop good visualizations of the users data <--- Number one priority

  a. Put data on website dashboard
  
  b. clean up datastructure sortage and processing 
4. Start to summarize gathered data and build v0 of the ai trainer
5. Implment trends and cleaner summarized information
6. Take into account users goals
7. Start to track workouts and reccomend future workouts
8. Develop plans for the users
9. Take into account food and diet along with giving advice and reccomendations
10. Look into memory and avoid reccomendations that contain disliked foods or food that user is allergic to
11. Start development of the app once website is working smoothly
12. Bring website online and have a server hosting everything

Who knows how long this will take but so far it has proven to be a fun developmental process and I have learned a lot.
